# 🧪 Multi-Class Classification Strategies Lab
This lab explores various strategies for handling multi-class classification problems using logistic regression. You'll implement both One-vs-All (OvA) and One-vs-One (OvO) strategies on a real-world dataset and assess model performance using relevant classification metrics.

The project includes an end-to-end machine learning workflow encapsulated in the obesity_risk_pipeline, which focuses on predicting obesity risk categories based on lifestyle and health indicators.

🎯 Objectives
Understand and apply one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Implement logistic regression using OvA and OvO strategies.

Evaluate classification models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Utilize a pipeline (obesity_risk_pipeline) for streamlined preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
